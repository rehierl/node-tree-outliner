## ordered sets of elements

* there is no single specific type of ordered set

Note that, in the course of this whole discussion, the focus will be on "linear
orders of nodes" which are the result of some tree traversal.

simple set

* a set is a group of elements in which all elements are different
* the elements in a (simple) set have no order whatsoever
* a simple set has no first, no last, and no n-th element
* a set can essentially only answer the "element-of" question
* a set appears as a black box

ordered set

* a (simple) set of elements that is paired with an order relation
* an order relation defines the relationship between the elements
* i.e. a set whose elements are ordered by an order relation

countable sets, total/well order

* sets can be totally ordered in various ways
* well-orders (see ordinal numbers) - natural numbers, least element
* other - integers, not guaranteed to have a least element
* key definition of whether a total order is also a well order
