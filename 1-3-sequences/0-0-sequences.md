# Sequences

* See "mathematics" for the core concept of sequences.
* every sequence is a net (topology)

## a function-based view on sequences

* `s = [ e1, ..., eN ]` for `(s in XTi)`
* `(f: (XTi,Index) -> Element)`
* note - closely related to orders
* note - distinct elements may hold the same value
