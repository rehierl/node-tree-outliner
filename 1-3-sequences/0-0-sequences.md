# Sequences

* See "mathematics" for the core concept of sequences.
* See "topology" for "every sequence is a net".

## Sequences are more than "sequences"

* `s = [ e1, ..., eN ]` for `(s in XTi)`
* `(f: (XTi,Index) -> Element)`
* note - closely related to orders
* note - distinct elements may hold the same value
* i.e. a sequence is a group of elements paired with an order-relation
