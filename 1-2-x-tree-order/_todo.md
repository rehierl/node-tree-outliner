# TODO - tree order

From a graph theoretical point of view, the above generic method used to define
a subtree is perfectly fine. That is because the result will always satisfy the
definition of a subtree.

The question however is, because each arborescence defines a partial order,
whether or not the descendants `d` in `T` of a leaf `(l in LS)` can be ignored.
Put differently, what effects does it have, if such descendants are omitted?

**TODO** - In order to answer that question,
further considerations need to be taken into account.

Recall that all the elements of a subset must also be elements of a superset.
