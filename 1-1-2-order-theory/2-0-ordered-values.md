## ordered sets

* there is no single specific type of ordered set
* an ordered set is a set paired with some order-relation

simple set

* a set is a group of elements in which all elements are different
* a simple set has no first, no last, and no n-th element
* i.e. the elements in a (simple) set have no order

ordered set

* a (simple) set of elements paired with an order-relation
* an order-relation defines the relationship between the elements
* i.e. a set whose elements are ordered by an order-relation

countable sets, total/well order

* sets can be totally ordered in various ways
* well-orders (see ordinal numbers) - natural numbers, least element
* other - integers, not guaranteed to have a least element
* key definition of whether a total order is also a well order
