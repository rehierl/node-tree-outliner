# Order isomorphism

isomorphism (A -> B)

* a mapping that can be reversed by an inverse morphism
* objects are isomorphic, if an isomorphism exists
* isomorphic objects appear to be "essentially equal"
* automorphism - (A -> A)

order isomorphism

* a monotone function
* an isomorphism for partially ordered sets

ordinal number

* ordinal number - generalization of "natural number"
* any finite set can be put in order by counting its elements
* i.e. label its elements with distinct natural numbers
* an ordinal number is used to describe the order type of a well ordered set

order type

* order isomorphic - ordered sets X and Y have the same order type
* requires a bijection (1:1, e.g. `n -> 2*n`)
* must be order-preserving
* every well-ordered set is order-equivalent to exactly one ordinal number
