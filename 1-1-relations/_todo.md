# TODOs

- there is no explicit order in a document tree
- it isn't as if the nodes hold a value according to which they are ordered
- the order required is a result of the tree's traversal
- that order changes with the node tree

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

* pre-order - subsequent with regards to subsequences?
* (<,>) - partial orders?
* total preorder - a strict weak order?

(<=)

* for any two integers (a and b), (a <= b) and/or (b <= a) are true
* regardless of how close/distant they are - assumed that (a != b)
* any number is in relationship with any other number
* i.e. no direct/strict relationship

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

## define total, complete relation ?!?

* for any pair `aRb` or `bRa` (or both) is true
* i.e. any elements is strictly related to another element
* not the same as - `aRb` for any pair of values
