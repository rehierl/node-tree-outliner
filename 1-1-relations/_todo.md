https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory
- a branch of mathematics which investigates the intuitive
  notion of order using binary relations
- a formal framework for "less than that", "precedes that"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preorder
- aka. quasiorder
- a binary relation that is - reflexive, transitive
- e.g. (<=)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation
- a special case of a preorder - a symmetric preorder
- provides partition into disjoint classes
- a binary relation that is reflexive, transitive, symmetric
- e.g. is-equal-to

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set#Formal_definition
- a special case of a preorder - an antisymmetric preorder
- a non-strict partial order is - reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric
- a partially ordered set (aka. poset) - set with a partial order
- total order - every pair in a partial order is comparable
- e.g. real numbers ordered by (<=)
- a strict partial order is - irreflexive, transitive, asymmetric
