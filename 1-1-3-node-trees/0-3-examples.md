# Examples

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, comparability graph

* aka. containment graph
* undirected edges - two vertices are comparable in a poset
* equivalent to containment graphs of set families

incomparability graph

* edges - two vertices are incomparable

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, intersection graph

* undirected edges - two sets intersect each other
* i.e. the intersection of connected sets is non-empty
* i.e. sets may overlap each other

classes of intersection graphs

* interval graphs
* and many more ...

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, interval graph

* a family of real intervals
* undirected edges - two intervals intersect each other
* i.e. the intersection of both intervals is non-empty
* i.e. two intervals may overlap each other

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, contact graph

* aka. tangency graph
* vertices - represent geometric objects (e.g. curves, lines, polygons)
* undirected edges - two geometric objects touch (but don't cross) each other
* similar to an intersection graph
