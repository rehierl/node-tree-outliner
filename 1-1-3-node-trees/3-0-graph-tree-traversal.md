# Graph/Tree traversal

* aspects related to traversing graphs/trees

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, graph traversal

* graph search is the process of visiting each vertex
* each visit involves the execution of operations (check, update, etc)
* classified by the order in which vertices are visited

graph traversal

* graph traversal may have to visit vertices more than once
* graph traversal needs to handle revisits (e.g. a visited flag)

depth-first search (DFS)

* visit child vertices before neighbors
* i.e. depth before breadth
* stack/recursion-based implementations
* stack/recursion used when backtracking
* e.g. topological sorts, planetarity testing

breadth-first search (BFS)

* visit the neighbors before visiting the children
* i.e. breadth before depth
* queue-based implementations
* e.g. shortest path, bipartiteness, flood fill

graph exploration

* a variant of graph traversal
* in cases where the knowledge of a graph is limited
* e.g. web pages, graphs of (seemingly) infinite size

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, tree traversal

* tree search is a special case of graph traversal
* will visit each vertex/node exactly once
* classified by the order in which nodes are visited
* there are several options to traverse trees
* e.g. depth-first, breadth-first and hybrids/variations
* unlike lists, a tree search is non-linear
* needs use stacks/queues to defer nodes for later visit

depth-first search (DFS)

* children before siblings
* children in left-to-right or first-to-last order
* alternatively in right-to-left or last-to-first order
* preorder (NLR) - visit the node before any child node
* inorder (LNR) - visit the node in between its left and right child
* postorder (LRN) - visit the node after all child nodes
* generic trees - nodes may have any number of child nodes
* generic search - NC*, C*N, N(C*N)*N, N(NC*)*N

breadth-first search (BFS)

* visit the nodes on a level before going any deeper

other search algorithms are possible

* which are neither DFS nor BFS
* i.e. hybrids/variations

infinite trees

* no strict/complete traversal possible
* also used in combination with over/super-sized trees
* i.e. trees of (seemingly) infinite size
* a strict DFS and BFS search may end up visiting no node at all
* hybrid methods exist that can visit countably infinite trees

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, depth-first search (DFS)

* visit a branch prior to moving to the next neighbor
* time complexity is O(#V + #E)
* O(#E) may vary between O(1) and O((#V)Â²)

types of edges

* tree edges - edges of the spanning tree
* forward edges - point to a leaf of a previous branch
* back edges - point to an ancestor in the current branch
* cross edges - point to a parent of a previous branch

DFS ordering

* `s = [v(1) .. v(i-1), v(i), v(i+1) .. v(n)]` is in DFS ordering, if
* `prefix(s,i) = [v(1) .. v(i-1)]` and `suffix(s,i) = [v(i+1) .. v(n)]`
* `index(s,v)` = index of last neighbor of `v` in `s`, otherwise `0`
* for all `(i in [2,n-1])`, `s(i)=v` is the vertex `v` such that
* `(index(prefix(i),v) >= index(prefix(i),w))` for all `w` in `suffix(s,i)`
* **TODO** - the last line could use some clarification

comments

* in graph speech, neighbors share edges
* in tree speech, replace "neighbors" by "parent or child"

Vertex ordering

* use DFS to linearly order the vertices
* pre-ordering - order the vertices in the order they were first visited
* post-ordering - order the vertices in the order they were last visited
* reverse post-ordering - flipped post-ordering

reverse post-ordering

* not the same as pre-ordering
* produces a topological sorting of any DAG
* often represents a natural linearization of control flow
* example if-then-else construct

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, breadth-first search (BFS)

* visits all neighbors prior to moving to the next level
* enqueue each node on a level as the root of a subtree to search
* which algorithm to use DFS/BFS depends on the problem domain
* same complexity as DFS

BFS ordering

* `s = [v(1) .. v(i-1), v(i), v(i+1) .. v(n)]` is in BFS ordering, if
* `prefix(s,i) = [v(1) .. v(i-1)]` and `suffix(s,i) = [v(i+1) .. v(n)]`
* `index(s,v)` = index of first neighbor of `v` in `s`, otherwise `+Infinity`
* for all `(i in [2,n-1])`, `s(i)=v` is the vertex such that
* `(index(prefix(i),v) <= index(prefix(i),w))` for all `w` in `suffix(i)`
* **TODO** - the last line could use some clarification
