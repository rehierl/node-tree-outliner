# TODO - hierarchy of trees

* about the outer border between an induced subtree and its supertree
* only one edge that leads into the subtree
* no edge that leads out of the subtree

however, since an induced subtree is based on a connected component, the
super-graph must contain the subtree as is. that is, an induced subtree
is formed by cutting away outer nodes - i.e. remove what is outside of it.
