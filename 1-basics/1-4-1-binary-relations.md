# Binary Relations

* binary relation := `R = (A, B, G)`
* `G subset-of (A X B)`
* `(#r == 2)` for any `r in R`, i.e. `(n == 2)`
* `dom(R) := G`, `type(R) := (A X B)`
* homogenous if `(A == B)`, otherwise heterogenous

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## related to

* `a related-to b`, if `(a,b) in R`
* a is strictly related to b
* synonymous - strictly, directly
* `b related-to a`, if `(b,a) in R'`
* b is also strictly related to a

clarification

* `a` and `b` are strictly related to each other, if `(a,b) in (R or inv(R))`
* both are related, even if the relation has no specific semantics

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## semantics

antonymous semantics

* `parent-of` <=> `child-of`
* `contains` <=> `element-of`
* `superset-of` <=> `subset-of`
