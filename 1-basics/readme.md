This chapter contains an overview of fundamental concepts and definitions:
sequences, pre-sequent, concatenation, relations, etc.

Note that the intention behind this note-like listing is to allow to understand
the expressions used in subsequent chapters. This chapter therefore needs to be
understood to be more about developing and communicating a style of notation.
