This chapter contains an overview of fundamental concepts and definitions:
sequences, pre-sequent, concatenation, relations, hierarchies, etc.

Note that the intention behind these note-like listings is to allow to
understand the expressions used in subsequent chapters. This chapter therefore
needs to be understood to be more about developing and communicating a style of
notation.
