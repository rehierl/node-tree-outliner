* Please be aware that, for as long as this repository is in a state of flux,
  the focus is on developing the design itself; not so much on fixing errata
  or perfect phrasing. The latter needs to be understood in the context of
  making clear statements.
* Please add a clear description to explain your changes.
* If applicable, add a reference to an existing issue.
