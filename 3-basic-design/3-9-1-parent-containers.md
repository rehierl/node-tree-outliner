# parent containers

(related to the implementation of sectioning nodes)

The focus of this part is on the implementation of:
Close one or more inner sections when exiting a parent container.

```
n0
=========
n1 n2 ...
```

* `n0` represents an inactive parent container
* `n0` is associated with section `s0`
* `n1,n2` represent type-2 sectioning nodes
* `n1,n2` declare sections `s1,s2`

By definition, the trace of section sequences is:

```
trace of sequences:     -  node event:
======================  -  ====================
(s0)                    -  just before entering n0
(s0,s1)                 -  just after exiting n1
(s0,s1,s2)              -  just after exiting n2
...                     -  ...
(s0,s1,s2)              -  just before exiting n0
(s0,s1)                 -  while exiting n0
(s0)                    -  just after exiting n0
```

Note that the sequence of sections just before entering the parent container
is identical to the sequence of sections just after exiting said container.
Because of that, an implementation must basically restore the sequence of
sections when exiting a parent container.

As mentioned before, any parent node can in principle act as the parent
container of one or more sections. The only exception to that rule are the
type-1 sectioning nodes: These always are parent containers. Because of that,
and when exiting any parent node, an implementation must test whether inner
sections need to be closed.

1. Inner sections may have parent containers that are descendants to `n0`.
   The inner sections of these parent containers will be closed before the
   exit event of `n0` is reached (i.e. the same issue, but with regards to
   inner containers).
2. `n0` is the parent container of inner sections, but some subsequent,
   non-default extended definition applies. These sections will be closed
   before the exit event of `n0` is entered.
3. `n0` is the parent container of inner sections, and no non-default rule
   applies. The exit event of `n0` must close these remaining open sections.

In short, the exit event of a given parent container must only close those
sections that remain to be open by the time the parent container is being
exited. All other closed inner sections can and will be ignored (i.e those
are no longer relevant).

Because of that, all relevant sections are part of the current section sequence.
Furthermore, and because all those sections are subsections to the section, with
which the parent container is associated, the relevant sections are located at
the very end of the current section sequence. Consequently, an implementation
must only pop and close the top-most sections from the section stack until the
current section matches the parent container's parent section:

```
onExitParentContainer(Node container) begin
  //- currentSection is a global reference
  while(currentSection !== container.parentSection) begin
    parentSection = currentSection.parentSection
    currentSection.close()
    currentSection = parentSection
  end
end
```

Note that ...

* all nodes are associated while they are being entered. Because of that, a
  parent container's parent section reference is always set when the parent
  container is being exited.
* the root node must be associated with the universal section. This edge
  case is relevant when the algorithm is about to exit the root node.
* the remaining open inner sections will be closed in reverse order. That
  is, subsections will be closed before their ancestor sections are closed.
* an implementation does not have to know how many sections need to be closed.
* the close operation of an implementation could have implicit side effects
  (e.g. due to releasing locked resources).

With regards to efficiency, it does not appear to be possible to gain anything
from maintaining a boolean `isParentContainer` flag variable. Therefore, and
apart from gaining some amount of additional clarity, an implementation does
not have to test beforehand (e.g. by the use of an `if-then` construct),
whether the node in question is indeed a parent container. That is, one test
must always be executed either way (i.e. even if the corresponding parent node
is actually not a parent container).
