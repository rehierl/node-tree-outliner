**TODO** -

common properties -
contains and/or embedded -
"tree unordered" (a summary) -

# TODO - set of sets

**TODO** -
extend disjoint/coupled definitions for (N > 2)?

Note that two or more sets have one or more elements in common, if the
intersection of all sets involved is non-empty. That is, an element which
is common to two or more sets must be an element of all those sets.

Note that two or more sets are disjoint from one another, if any two distinct
sets are disjoint. Put differently, there are no two sets within such a set of
sets that have even one element in common.

## TODO - hierarchy of sets

**TODO** -
define sub-hierarchy? -
required to proof (CE(h) == V) -
as counterpart to sub-tree?

**TODO** -
go meta with forests? -
a forest is itself a set of elements -
a hierarchy of forests? -
"an outline of an outline"? -
an unordered/ordered forest?

**TODO** -
given a set of elements V -
how many hierarchies are theoretically possible? -
what is the max possible number of sets in P (hint: powerset)? -
with regards to: resource management, allocation of resources

**TODO** -
`(css(l) in P)` iff `(l in LS)` -
reduces the number of possible hierarchies -
it requires that (css(p) !in P) for (p in PS) -
i.e. each parent set removes a possible set in P -
