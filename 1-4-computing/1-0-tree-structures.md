# Tree structures in computing

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## Binary tree

* each node has no more than two child nodes (left and right)
* store data in a particular order
* that order is maintained when changing the tree

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## Threaded binary tree

* a binary tree variant
* holds additional pointers to speed up traversals
* the pointers reference the next/previous node in the search
* essentially allows a "list"-based traversal
