## wikipedia, order type

* two "order isomorphic" ordered sets have the same "order type"
* i.e. needs an order-preserving bijective mapping
* e.g. (n -> 2*n) on the set of integer numbers

## wikipedia, order isomorphism

order isomorphism

* a monotone function
* an isomorphism for partially ordered sets

ordinal number

* ordinal number - generalization of "natural number"
* any finite set can be put in order by counting its elements
* i.e. label its elements with distinct natural numbers
* an ordinal number is used to describe the order type of a well ordered set

order type

* order isomorphic - ordered sets X and Y have the same order type
* requires a bijection (1:1, e.g. `n -> 2*n`)
* must be order-preserving
* every well-ordered set is order-equivalent to exactly one ordinal number
