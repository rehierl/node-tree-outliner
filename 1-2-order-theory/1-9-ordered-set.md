# Ordered sets

* there is no one distinct type of ordered set

simple sets of values

* a set is a group of values in which all values are different
* the values in a (simple) set have no order whatsoever
* a simple set has no first, no last, and no n-th value
* a set can essentially only answer the "element-of" question
* due to "no order" and the "in" operator, a set appears as a black box

ordered sets of values

* a (simple) set of elements that is paired with some order
* the order relation defines the relationship between the elements
* i.e. a set whose elements have some order

countable sets, total/well order

* can be totally ordered in various ways
* well-orders (see ordinal numbers) - natural numbers, least element
* other - integers, not guaranteed to have a least element
* key definition of whether a total order is also a well order
