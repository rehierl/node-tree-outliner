# Mixed topics

The following sections don't indent to be complete. The notes in this chapter
only try to reflect the core principles/aspects of the following topics. The
purpose is to grasp the general idea/concept.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, hereditary property

* an object property that is inherited to all sub-objects
* e.g. in topology, graph theory, set theory
* graph theory - a graph property which also holds for its induced subgraphs
* set theory - (/see/ "hereditary sets" /)

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, ontology

* used in computer/information science
* includes - representation, naming, categories, properties, relations
* used to limit complexity and to organize information
* intended to improve problem solving - i.e. new knowledge

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, taxonomy

* is the practice/study of classification
* originated from the classification of organisms
* moved towards the classification of things/concepts
* i.e. including the underlying principles
* taxonomies are in general hierarchical, but not required to be
* i.e. in case of elements that belong to several taxonomies
* taxonomy narrower than ontologies

taxon - (pl.) taxa

* represents a unit of classification in taxonomy
* in biology - a group of populations seen to form a unit

mathematically

* aka. containment hierarchy
* a hierarchical taxonomy is a tree structure of classifications
* the root node represents a classification that applies to all objects
* descendants are more specific classifications that apply to subsets

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, model theory

* study of classes of mathematical structures with mathematical logic
* object of study are models of formalized theories
* a theory is formed by sentences in a formal language
* a model is a structure that satisfies the sentences of a theory
* in retrospect, mathematical logic may be understood to be model-theoretical

set theory

* model theory can be formalized within ZFC set theory
* some results in model theory depend on set-theoretic axioms beyond ZFC
* i.e. model theory has ties with set theory
