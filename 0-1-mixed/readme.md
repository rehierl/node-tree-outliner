# General scientific topics

This content is intended as an overview of general scientific aspects.

Note that these contents only scratch the surface of the corresponding topics.
Content in this section therefore needs to be understood as "first contact"
with topics that might/are related to the overall discussion, but not (yet)
relevant enough to dig any deeper.
