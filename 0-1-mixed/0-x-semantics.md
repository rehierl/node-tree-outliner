# Semantics

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, semantics

* aka. semasiology
* the study of meaning in languages, logics
* facial expressions, body language have semantic content
* other forms of language bear other semantic content
* intersect with other fields of study - e.g. syntax
* hence, the formal study of semantics is manifold and complex

theories in semantics

* formal sem. - a formalized theory of natural language semantics
* truth-conditional sem. - aims to associate each sentence with a meta-language
* conceptual sem. - attempts to explain properties of argument structure
* i.e. syntactic properties reflect the meaning of words
* e.g. to grasp the subtle differences in the meaning of words
* lexical sem. - study of word meaning
* i.e. the meaning of a word is fully reflected by its context
* computational sem. - aims to process linguistic meaning

in computer science

* "semantics" refers to the meaning of language constructs
* i.e. provide the rules for interpreting syntax

**SKIPPED** - most of the content

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, formal semantics

* seeks to understand linguistic meaning
* via relationships between expressions in natural language
* tools are formal logic, formal language theory

## wikipeida, opposite semantics

* opposites (i.e. opposite words) are in an inherently binary relationship
* e.g. big/small, long/short, precede/follow, etc.
* i.e. the binary relationship (aka. opposition) is: "one, but not the other"

general discussion

* opposites are simultaneously different and similar in meaning
* typically differ in one dimension
* also, not all words have an opposite
* i.e. non-opposable like species

the term antonym

* an "antonym" is one of a pair of antonymous words
* commonly taken to be synonymous - but also has other meanings
* graded antonyms - e.g. hot/cold
* i.e. defined based on a continuous spectrum
* complementary antonyms - e.g. push/pull, odd/even
* i.e. there is no continuous spectrum
* relational antonyms - e.g. teacher/pupil, predator/prey
* i.e. in opposition via the corresponding relationship
* each item is the antithesis of the other

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, converse semantics

* aka. relational antonyms, complementary antonyms
* pairs of words that refer to a relationship from opposite points of view
* implies the existence of the same relationship when the objects are reversed
* e.g. parent/child, borrow/lend, above/below, etc.
* i.e. a converse either/or relationship exists
