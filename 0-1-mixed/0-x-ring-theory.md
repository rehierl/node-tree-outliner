# Ring theory

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, ring theory

* the study of algebraic structures
* structures in which addition and multiplication are defined
  and have similar properties to those operations defined for integers

commutative rings

* multiplication is commutative (hint: order of operands)
* resemble familiar number systems
* numbers are often replaced by ideals
* prime ideals try to capture the essence of prime numbers
* algebraic geometry - solving polynomials, and much more
* algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory and commutative algebra
  are intimately interconnected - i.e. no distinct borders

non-commutative rings

* resemble rings of matrices
* attempts to define non-commutative geometry
* representation theory - studies abstract algebraic structures
* represent elements as linear transformations (matrices)
* representations make abstract algebraic objects more concrete
* operations - non-commutative matrix addition and multiplication

**SKIPPED** - not my cuppa tea ...

## wikipedia, ring theory, ideals

* a special subset of a ring
* generalize subsets of integers
* e.g. even numbers, multiples of 3, etc.
* closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication
* the closure and absorption property are the defining characteristics

definition

* ring (R,+,*), additive group (R,+), ideal I (R,+)
* ideal I (aka. two-sided ideal) is an additive subgroup
* such that it "absorbs multiplication by elements of R"
* (x*r) and (r*x) in I for all (x in I) and (r in R)
* right ideal - if only (x*r) in I
* left ideal - if only (r*x) in I
