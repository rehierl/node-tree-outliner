# TODO - graph theory

graph theory treats vertices and edges as being
more or less independent from one another -
i.e. vertices can be freely connected with each other -

graph theory in general seems focus on edges -
i.e. disconnected vertices appear to be ignored -
e.g. the (standard) definition of a complement graph -
i.e. there is a degree of freedom in choosing the edges -

order theory in general seems to focus on vertices -
i.e. the edges are a consequence of the corresponding operator -
i.e. the edges are the result of pairwise comparing all vertices -
i.e. there is no freedom in which edges to add -

the edges in a tree are fixed -
you can't add another edge without adding cycles -
you can't add another edge without adding a 2nd parent to a node -
recall that a single root must exist and that a root has no parent -
i.e. add a node as the parent of the root, and you no longer have a tree -
you can't remove an edge without breaking a tree's connectivity -
i.e. the removal of a single edge will result in a disconnected graph -
the order-operator of a tree is the ancestor-of comparison operator -
