A relation that only has an empty set of vertices (i.e. `(V == {})`) and no
edge in `E` (i.e. `(E == {})`), will be referred to as the null relation, or
as the "empty relation" `Ø`. That is, the null relation is a binary tuple of
empty sets (i.e. `Ø := ({},{})`).

In contrary to that, a relation that has a set of `n` vertices and an edge
for every pair of vertices, will be referred to as the complete relation `Rn`.
That is, the set of edges of a complete relation is equal to the Cartesian
product over its set of vertices (i.e. `(E == V×V)`). (Note that complete
relations are used similar to the concept of an universal set `U` in the
context of simple sets of elements).
