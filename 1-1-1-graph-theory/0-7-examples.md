# Examples

* more examples for particular graphs

## wikipedia, comparability graph

* aka. containment graph
* undirected edges - two vertices are comparable in a poset
* equivalent to containment graphs of set families

incomparability graph

* edges - two vertices are incomparable

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, interval graph

* a family of real intervals
* undirected edges - two intervals intersect each other
* i.e. the intersection of both intervals is non-empty
* i.e. two intervals may overlap each other

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, contact graph

* aka. tangency graph
* vertices - represent geometric objects (e.g. curves, lines, polygons)
* undirected edges - two geometric objects touch (but don't cross) each other
* similar to an intersection graph

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, cograph

* aka. complement-reducible graph, P4-free graph
* generated from a K1 graph by complementation and disjoint union
* examples - complete/cluster/threshold graphs

construction

* any 1-vertex graph is a cograph
* if G is a cograph, then so is its complement
* if G and H are cographs, then so is their disjoint union

remarks

* ties to series-parallel graphs
* has several other characterizations
