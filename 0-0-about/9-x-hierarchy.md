# Hierarchies

( these are notes taken from the corresponding wikipedia pages )

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, heterarchy

* a system of elements that are unranked (non-hierarchical, equal),
  or ranked a number of different ways
* rank - a relative position, value, level, importance, etc.
* somewhere between networks and hierarchies

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, hierarchy

* an arrangement of items in which the items are
  represented as above, below or equal
* items are linked directly or indirectly, vertically or diagonally
* only direct link is to an immediate superior
* indirect links extend upwards/downwards, following a path
* horizontally linked - common direct or indirect superior

common terms

* points of interests are - objects, entities, items, member, etc.
* system, dimension - the entirety of objects
* rank - relative - importance, value, power, authority, etc.
* level - a set of objects with the same rank
* ordering - the (general) arrangement of ranks/levels
* hierarchy - the particular arrangement of ranks/levels
* collection - all objects at one level
* superior - an object from a higher level - ancestor
* superior - closer to the apex as a subordinate/inferior
* subordinate - at a lower level - descendant
* hierarch - the object(s) at the highest level
* peer - an object at the same level
* neighbor - adjacent objects - superior and subordinates
* distance - the minimum number of connections between two objects
* span - the number of subordinates an object has

degree of branching

* degree - the number of direct subordinates - max,min,avg,etc.
* i.e. the degree may be constant (same for all) or variable
* linear hierarchy - max-degree is one
* branching hierarchy - max-degree > one
* flat hierarchy - max-degree towards infinity
* overlapping hierarchy - some object have more than one parent

visualization

* typically as a pyramid
* i.e. apex at the top, base at the bottom level
* tree-mapping - e.g. via nested rectangular areas
* radial trees - hierarchy in the center,
  first level on the first outer circle/orbit
* fractal maps - (no further info)

visual hierarchy

* an presentation that implies importance
* created by the visual contrast between objects
* graphic design - guides ones eye via visual organization
* conceptual hierarchy - based on the inherent purpose of a design
* e.g. cartographic design - emphasize important features over lesser ones

informal representation

* no element is superior to itself
* i.e. not circular relationships
* the hierarch is superior to all
* i.e. the association between two objects is transitive

mathematical

* a partially ordered set or poset
* each element shares a particular unambiguous property
* according to this property, elements are grouped into levels
* class - the resulting levels
* use of parenthesis is a representation of a hierarchy

nested/inclusion hierarchy

* a hierarchical ordering of nested sets
* e.g. matryoshka - russian dolls
* the organizational schemes behind taxonomies and systematic classifications
* illustrate self-similarity and recursion

containment hierarchy

* a direct extrapolation of the nested hierarchy
* every set must be strict, every set must be distinct
* e.g. class inheritance in object-oriented programming

subsumptive hierarchy

* classification from the general to the specific
* aka. taxonomic hierarchy, is-a hierarchy

compositional containment hierarchy

* ordering of parts that make up a system
* emergent properties - a collective property - e.g. neurons vs. brain

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, hierarchy in mathematics

* a set-theoretical object consisting of a preorder defined on a set
* preordered set - often referred to as an ordered set
* mathematical hierarchy - synonymous to a preordered set
* the set of natural numbers has a natural pre-order structure (<=)
* not to be confused with the general concept of a social hierarchy

containment/natural hierarchy

* in computer science
* partially ordered sets whose elements are objects of increasing complexity
* class-containment relation - the preorder defining the hierarchy
* containment hierarchies are special cases of hierarchies

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, hereditary property

* an object property that is inherited to all sub-objects
* e.g. in topology, graph theory, set theory
* graph theory - a graph property which also holds for its induced subgraphs
* set theory - see pure/hereditary sets
