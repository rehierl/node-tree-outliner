# Hierarchies

( these are notes taken from the corresponding wikipedia pages )

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## wikipedia, heterarchy

* a system of elements that are unranked (non-hierarchical, equal),
  or ranked a number of different ways
* rank - a relative position, value, level, importance, etc.
* somewhere between networks and hierarchies

## wikipedia, hierarchy

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy
- an arrangement of items in which some are
  above, below or at-the-same-level of others
- items are linked directly or indirectly,
  vertically or diagonally
- only direct link to an immediate superior
- horizontally linked - common direct or indirect superior
common terms
- rank - relative value, worth, complexity
- level - a set of objects with the same rank or importance
- superior vs. subordinate
degree of branching
- hierarchies categorized base on "maximum degree"
- degree - number of children a node has
- linear hierarchy - maximum degree is 1
- branching - max-degree >= 2
- flat - max-degree towards infinity
- overlapping - at least one object has two parent objects
visualization
- depicted as pyramid
- apex at the top, base at the bottom level
- radial trees
informal
- (1) no element is superior to itself (i.e. not circular)
- the association between two objects is always transitive
- (2) one element is the hierarch (i.e. has a leader/root)
mathematical
- a partially ordered set or poset
- each element shares a particular unambiguous property
- elements are grouped according to these properties
- class - the resulting levels
- use of parenthesis is a representation of a hierarchy
subtypes
- nested - 
- matryoshka (russian dolls)

## wikipedia, hierarchy in mathematics

* a set-theoretical object consisting of a preorder defined on a set
* preordered set - often referred to as an ordered set
* mathematical hierarchy - synonymous to a preordered set
* the set of natural numbers has a natural pre-order structure (<=)
* not to be confused with the general concept of a social hierarchy

containment/natural hierarchy

* in computer science
* partially ordered sets whose elements are objects of increasing complexity
* class-containment relation - the preorder defining the hierarchy
* containment hierarchies are special cases of hierarchies

## wikipedia, hereditary property

* an object property that is inherited to all sub-objects
* e.g. in topology, graph theory, set theory
* graph theory - a graph property which also holds for its induced subgraphs
* set theory - see pure/hereditary sets
