This folder is intended to communicate graph/tree-related aspects: definitions
of node trees, tree traversal, particular tree-related sequences, etc.

Note that a tree's node sequence is most important to the whole discussion.
The other sequences could however still prove to be useful when communicating
the resulting design.
