# Theoretical Purity

* [W3C, HTML, Priority of Constituencies](
  https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies
)

This self-imposed design principle of the W3C's HTML specification states that
users have precedence above anything else:

```
users > authors > implementors > specifiers > theoretical purity
```

Sure thing, because in principle there is no value in having to teach end users
anything about science (e.g. Thermodynamics, Physics, Chemistry, etc.), if all
that a user wants to do is to hop in a car and use it to drive from A to B. The
world we live in is simply too complex to know it all. So yes, to that I fully
agree: It must be possible to use the end product without the requirement of
several degrees in several fields of science.

With that in mind, and with regards to the issue at hand, there seems to be a
fundamental misconception of what is involved:

```
users, authors, implementors                   => users
authors of the specification (aka. specifiers) => developers
theoretical purity                             => science

users <-> developers <-> science
```

As a link between users and science (e.g. mathematics), it is the responsibility
of developers (i.e. specifiers) to figure it all out: How is science involved?
How can it be used to produce an easy-to-use end product? And, how can we
communicate "it" to the users? How do we teach them to properly use "it"?

Obviously, and in the context of this discussion, the end product is a
seemingly minor aspect, which is none-the-less integral to documents:
The ability to structure documents on a logical level.

**TODO**

* We can not break scientific principles, no one can.

The problem with that is this: Spec developers can not break scientific rules.
It really is that simple. Like everyone else, they are bound by scientific
principles. And as such, all they can do is try to figure out how they can
mediate between those rules and the users. However, and that is at the very
epicenter of the whole mess we are in: Users seem to keep asking developers
to break those rules.

Users and developers alike have to accept that any attempt to develop a design
which is in conflict with fundamental principles is (sooner or later) guaranteed
to fail. Such a design can not, and will never do what it is supposed to do.

No, and in this particular case, good enough is simply not good enough.

* So, who is to blame? - Everyone and no one.

* Last but not least: Theoretical Purity
