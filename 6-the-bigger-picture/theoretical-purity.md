# Theoretical Purity

* [W3C, HTML, Priority of Constituencies](
  https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies
)

This self-imposed design principle of the W3C's HTML specification states that
users have precedence above anything else:

```
users > authors > implementors > specifiers > theoretical purity
```

In principle there is no value in having to teach end users anything about
science (e.g. Physics, Chemistry, Thermodynamics, etc.), if all that a user
wants to do is to hop in a car and drive from A to B. The world we live in
is too complex to know it all. So yes, to that I fully agree: It must be
possible to use the end product without the requirement of several degrees
in different fields of science.

Note that, in the context of this discussion, the end product is a seemingly
minor aspect, which is none-the-less integral to documents: The ability to
structure documents on a logical level.

With that in mind, and with regards to the issue at hand, there seems to be
a misconception of what is involved:

```
users, authors, implementors                    =>  users
authors of the specification (aka. specifiers)  =>  developers
theoretical purity                              =>  science

users  <->  developers  <->  science
```

As a link between users and science (e.g. mathematics), it is the responsibility
of developers (i.e. specifiers) to figure it out: How is science involved and
how can it be used to produce an easy-to-use end product? And finally, how can
"it" be communicated to users?

**TODO**

* We can not break scientific principles, no one can.

The problem with that is this: Spec developers can not break scientific rules.
Like everyone else, they are bound by scientific principles. And as such, all
they can do is try to figure out how they can mediate between those principles
and the users.

Users and developers alike have to accept that any attempt to develop a design
that is in conflict with fundamental principles is (sooner or later) guaranteed
to fail. Such a design can not, and will never do what it is supposed to do.

* In this particular case, good enough is simply not good enough.
* So, who is to blame? - Everyone and no one.
