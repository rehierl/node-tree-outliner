===============

The purpose of this repository is to flesh out a design that can be used to
implement a general-purpose outliner for any rooted ordered tree of nodes.

**PRELIMINARY LICENSE**

ยง1 Free for science and discussions.

ยง3 General goals

The ultimate goal is to end up with a royalty-free, free-for-all design.
Any use that is in conflict with this general goal is prohibited.

The reason for this restricted preliminary license is to have a clear, in
itself consistent design, that is not in any conflict with any node tree.
That is, in order to prevent widespread use of an "unfinished" design.
