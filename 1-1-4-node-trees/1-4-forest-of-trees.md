# Forest of trees

* note - commonly defined as "subgraph of a forest"

A **forest (of trees)** `F` is the disjoint union of trees.

* `F := (N,E)`
* `N` is the possibly empty set of nodes
* `(E subset-of NÃ—N)` is the possibly empty set of edges
* such that `(E(e) subset-of N)` for any `(e in E)`
* i.e. both endpoints of each edge are nodes in `N`
