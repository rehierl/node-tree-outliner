# TODO - node trees

what are sections?

* the union of sets of nodes
* i.e. no crossing borders

thoughts

* sequences are not required, if ...
* a topological sorting can be defined
* based on the relationships of sets

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
sub-graph, sub-tree

* the union of subtrees
* (strict) subtree as "induced subtrees"
* i.e. induced by its root node
* properly define "sub-graph", "sub-tree"
* disjoint tree
