# Common properties

A unique point of view: The elements within a CSS are no "object properties",
they are "object identifiers". That is, any CE can be seen as a reference to
data that is unique to a set. This allows to associate a property with a set
that may hold the same value as the property of another set (e.g. a tag name).

The CSS of a set can obviously be considered to represent data which is "unique"
to that set. That is, because there is always exactly one least significant set
which holds all the elements in that CSS. As such, the non-empty CSS of a set
can be understood to further characterize the corresponding set.
