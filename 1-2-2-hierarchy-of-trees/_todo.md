# TODO - hierarchy of trees

a set of trees is not necessarily a forest -
i.e. distinct trees in such a set may be coupled with each other

the definition of trees is such that any tree has one or more nodes -
i.e. in contrary to empty sets, there are no empty trees -
however, empty forests and empty graphs do exist

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

* the union of any two trees in a proper setup is either a forest or a tree
* if it is a tree, then the resulting tree is equal to the larger tree
* the intersection of any two trees in a proper setup is either empty or a tree
* if it is a tree, then the resulting tree is equal to the smaller tree
* in both cases, the resulting tree is an element in the setup (i.e. closed)
