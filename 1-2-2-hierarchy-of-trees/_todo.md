# TODO - hierarchy of trees

a set of trees is not necessarily a forest -
i.e. distinct trees in such a set may be coupled with each other

the definition of trees is such that any tree has one or more nodes -
i.e. in contrary to empty sets, there are no empty trees -
however, empty forests and empty graphs do exist
