# Overview

This overview needs to be understood to outline the context of those aspects
that are related to sequences of elements.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## Ordered sequences (s)

Even though sequences can be created in any number of different ways, the focus
of this discussion is on the traversal of document trees. To be more accurate,
the focus is on sequences whose elements are the nodes of a tree.

* `T := (N,R)` is a **finite directed acyclic tree of nodes**
* `T` is commonly, but not necessarily an ordered tree
* `N` is the tree's set of nodes
* `(R subset-of NÃ—N)` is the tree's endo-relation
* `sem(R)` := `((ni,nj) in R)` iff `(ni parent-of nj)`

During the traversal of a tree, each node will be visited no more than once,
and all nodes will be visited one after another. As soon as a node is visited,
the tree traversal can be understood to associate the next available ordinal
number with each node. Because of that, a strict total order `P` exists on a
tree's set of nodes.

Note that this order will in general be referred to as the traversal's **node
order**, **visit order**, **enter order** - i.e. a **topological sorting**.

Put differently, the traversal of a tree can be seen to add/append/associate
each node to/with a sequence of nodes `s` as soon as a node is entered. Once
the tree traversal has finished, such sequences will contain all the nodes
(i.e. `(E(s) == N)`) in the traversal's enter order. That is, the index of a
node in `s` represents the ordinal number that a traversal associates with a
node.

Note that such a node sequence will in general be referred to as the **(node)
sequence (of a tree)** - i.e. a **trace of nodes**.

* `(s, seq: T -> N*)` is a function such that
* `s(t)` is the node sequence `(s in N*)` of tree `(t in T)`
* `s = s(t) = [{ n1, n2, ..., nk }]` where all `(s[i] in N)`

In the context of this discussion, a sequence of nodes `s` contains no node
more than once. Because of that, the node sequence of a tree is a sequence
such that `(#E(s) == #s)`. A node sequence can therefore be understood to
define an order relation `P, P(s) := (E(s),<)` on the set of nodes such that
`(s[i] < s[j])` iff `(i < j)`. And because `P` does not contain any pair of
incomparable nodes, the order of nodes defined is a strict total order.

Note that a sequence of elements, for which `(#E(s) == #s)` is true, will in
general be referred to as an **ordered sequence**, or as a **linear sequence**.

* `s = [{ n1, ..., nk }] in N*` is an ordered sequence of nodes
* `(E(s) subset-of N)` and `(#E(s) == #s)` are both true
* `P := (E(s),<)` where `(s[i] < s[j])` iff `(i < j)`
* `P` is an ordered set of nodes in enter order
* `sem(P)` := `xPy` iff `(x entered-before y)`
* `P` is a strict total order

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## Set of ordered sequences (S)

The traversal of a tree is however not limited to creating only one sequence.
That is because a tree traversal can be used to create a sequence for the whole
tree and one for each (strict) subtree. Consequently, a tree traversal can be
understood to add each node to one or more sequences and therefore to create
the set of node sequences `S`.

Note that such a set of sequences will in general be referred to as the **set
of (node) sequences (of a tree)**.

Put differently, each node within a tree can be understood to represent the
root of a subtree for which a node sequence will be created. Because of that,
each tree can be seen to represent `#N` distinct subtrees: `(#N-1)` strict
subtrees and the subtree that begins in the tree's root.

Note that the subtree of a node, which has the given node as its root, will
in general be referred to as the **(sub)tree of a node**. In addition to that,
the sequence created for such a subtree will in general be referred to as the
**node sequence of a node**. The node sequence of a tree is therefore identical
to the node sequence of its root. Furthermore, the root of a subtree will in
general be referred to as the **defining node** of a subtree/sequence.

* `(t, tree: N -> T)` is a function such that
* `tree(n)` is the subtree that has node `n` as its root
* i.e. `tree(n)` represents the subtree's endo-relation

Likewise, ...

* `(r, root: T -> N)` is inverse to `tree()`
* `root(t)` is the root node `r` of tree `t`
* i.e. `(tree(root(t)) == t)` and `(root(tree(r)) == r)` are both true

The root node of a tree always is the first node in the sequence of a tree.
That is because a tree's root is entered first during the tree's traversal.
In general, node `n` is the first node of sequence `s` created for `tree(n)`.

*  `(s[1] == n) <-> (s == seq(tree(n)))`

Consequently, no node sequence created for another subtree will begin with the
exact same node. The sequence created for the subtree of a node will therefore
be distinct from the sequences of any other subtree. The set of sequences `S`
of a tree will therefore hold one sequence per node. That is, each node `n`
can be understood to be associated with its own unique sequence `s`.

* `(#S == #N)`
* `(s, seq: N -> S) := seq(tree(n))` is a function such that
* `s(n)` is the node sequence `s` of node `n`

Note that, because a total order `P` exists on the set of nodes `N`, and because
each node is associated with a unique sequence `(s in S)`, the set of sequences
`S` can also be understood to be an ordered set of sequences:

* `Q := (S,<)` where `(s < t)` iff `xPy` for `(s = s(x))` and `(t = s(y))`
* i.e. the sequences are ordered according to the defining nodes
* `Q` is an ordered set of sequences in enter or creation order
* `sem(Q)` := `xQy` iff `(x entered/created-before y)`
* `Q` is also strict total order

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## Example sets of sequences

In general, and as soon as some node `n` is entered, the traversal of a tree
can be understood to create the node's sequence `s(n)` and to add it to the
set of sequences `S`. Furthermore, and because node `n` was entered, the tree
traversal initializes `s(n)` by adding `n` to that sequence as its first node
(i.e. `(s[1] == n)`). Note that this process will be referred to as the
initialization of `s(n)`.

```
node tree T   set of sequences S
===========   ==================
 n1 -> n2     s(n1) := [n1, n2]
              s(n2) := [n2]
```

* (A1) Node `n1` is entered first:
  `s(n1)` needs to be initialized.
* (A2) Node `n2` is entered next:
  `s(n2)` needs to be initialized.
* (A3) Node `n1` was not yet exited:
  `n2` needs to be added to `s(n1)`.
* (A4) Next, `n2` is exited:
  no more nodes will be added to `s(n2)`.
* (A5) Finally, `n1` is exited:
  no more nodes will be added to `s(n1)`.

```
node tree T   set of sequences S
===========   ==================
 n1 -|-> n2   s(n1) := [n1, n2, n3]
     |-> n3   s(n2) := [n2]
              s(n3) := [n3]
```

* (B0) This fragment is understood
  to begin just after step (A3).
* (B1) Next, `n2` is exited:
  no more nodes will be added to `s(n2)`.
* (B2) Node `n3` is entered next:
  `s(n3)` needs to be initialized.
* (B3) Node `n1` was not yet exited:
  `n3` needs to be added to `s(n1)`.
* (B4) Next, `n3` is exited:
  no more nodes will be added to `s(n3)`.
* (B5) Finally, `n1` is exited:
  no more nodes will be added to `s(n1)`.

Based on these examples, the following observations can be made:

* Due to `(s(n)[1] == n)`, no `(s in S)` will ever be empty.
* Any `(s in S)` is an infix to `s(n1)`.
* The sequence of a descendant will always be a
  strict infix to the sequences of its ancestors.
* The sequence of a descendant will never be a
  prefix to the sequences of its ancestors.
* The sequence of a descendant may be, but does not have to be
  a strict suffix to one or more sequences of its ancestors
  - e.g. `(s(n3) strict-suffix-to s(n1))`.
* `S` may contain sequences that are disjoint
  - e.g. `(s(n2) disjoint-to s(n3))`.
* If two distinct sequences in `S` have one or more nodes in
  common, then one sequence is a strict subsequence of the other.
* Each node will be added to `#A(n)+1` sequences,
  where `A(n)` is the set of ancestors of node `n`.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## A stream-based perspective

As can be seen from the above examples, nodes are added to sequences as soon as
the defining node of a sequence was entered. In addition to that, the traversal
will continue to add nodes to sequences until their defining nodes are exited.

In the context of a tree traversal, any sequence can therefore be understood to
have the following states: (1) A sequence is **undefined** for as long as its
defining node has not yet been entered. (2) A sequence is **open** for as long
as the traversal of a tree is still visiting the descendants of its defining
node. (3) A sequence is **closed** as soon its defining node is exited.

Note that this state-based perspective on sequences will in general be referred
to as the **stream-based perspective**. That is, the above node sequences can,
be, similar to binary streams, understood to represent streams of nodes.

Because of that, and at any given point in time during the traversal of a tree,
the set of sequences `S` can be understood to be the union of disjoint sets of
sequences such that each subset contains all those sequences that have the same
state. Most importantly, a tree traversal can be understood to contain a set of
all open sequences `O`. Because of that, a tree traversal can be understood to
add each node to all sequences in the **current set of open sequences**. Note
that, given the traversal's current node `n`, `O` contains `#A(n)+1` sequences.

In addition to that, and once a defining node is entered, all the nodes of the
corresponding subtree are added to its sequence of nodes. That is, this view
neither supports a "paused", nor a "continued" state. Because of that, all
sequences can be understood to be **consecutive** with regards to the tree
traversal's node order.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## An interval-based perspective

Due to all sequences in `S` being consecutive with regards to the traversal's
enter order, and because of that order being total, any subsequence always has
a first and a last node. As such, any sequence has a least (i.e. first) and a
greatest (i.e. last) element/node.

Put differently, any sequence in `S` can be understood to contain all the nodes
in between its first (`n1`) and its last node (`nk`). That is, all the nodes of
a sequence can be inferred from its first and last node.

Consequently, and in the context of the corresponding tree traversal, all
sequences in `S` can be expressed as two-node intervals `[n1,nk]`. And because
each node has a unique index `i(n)` in a tree's node sequence, all sequences
can be expressed as two-index intervals `[i1,ik]` where `(i1 := i(n1))` and
`(ik := i(nk))`. Finally, these index intervals allow to express each sequence
as pairs of offset-length values `[offset,length]` where `(offset := i1)` and
`(length := ik-i1+1)`.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## Related ordered sequences

As before, the traversal of a tree can be understood to add each node to all
open sequences. Because of that, the sequence of a descendant always is an infix
to the sequences of its ancestors. That is, the sequences of descendant nodes
are related to the sequences of their ancestors. Consequently, the relationship
of a node with all the other nodes in a tree is mapped onto the node sequences.

Furthermore, and because any sequence is an infix to the root's node sequence,
all sequences correspond with the tree traversal's enter order. That is, all
sequences represent sub-orders to the traversal's enter order.

This chapter will therefore focus on the introduction of those definitions that
allow to describe the relationship an ordered sequence in `S` has with all the
other sequences in `S`.
