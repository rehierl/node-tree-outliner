# Sequences are more than "sequences"

* `s = [ e1, ..., eN ]` for `(s in ×Ti)`
* `(f: (×Ti,Index) -> Element)`
* note - closely related to orders
* note - distinct elements may hold the same value
* i.e. a sequence is a group of elements paired with an order-relation
* sequences represent ordered multisets - nope
* sequences may represent ordered sets
