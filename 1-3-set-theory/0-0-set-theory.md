# Set theory

( See "mathematics" for the core concept of sets )

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
## power set

* `A := { 1, 2 }`
* `P(A) := { {}, {1}, {2}, {1,2} }`
* `P(A)` is the set of all subsets in `A`

clarification

* `P(A)` always contains the empty set `{}`
* `#P(A) = 2^N = 8`, if `#A = N = 3`

## ordered set

simple sets of values

* a set is a group of values in which all values are different
* the values in a (simple) set have no order whatsoever
* a simple set has no first, no last, and no n-th value
* a set can essentially only answer the "element-of" question
* due to "no order" and the "in" operator, a set appears as a black box

ordered sets of values

* a (simple) set of elements that is paired with some order
* the order relation defines the relationship between the elements
